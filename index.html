        <h2>The Department of Economics</h2>
                    <p>The Honours course in Economics was introduced in the college in 1932.
            Students studying Economics (Honours) get a plethora of opportunities
            starting from being in academics, banking sector, government services,
            though the majority of students are now getting employed in Data Analytics
            which is a booming service industry with ample scope of growth. Asutosh
            College, because of its convenient access to many forms of transportation and
            strong academic standing of the department, has always attracted the
            students not only of its neighborhood but also of the entire state. Most of the
            students who have completed their graduation from this institution are now
            placed in prestigious organizations throughout the globe. Along with the
            traditional method of classroom teaching the department takes utmost care
            in meeting students' academic queries.The department also organizes
            students' seminars, workshops and invited lecture sessions regularly. The
            members of faculty participate in international, national and state-level
            seminars, conferences and workshops on a regular basis as part of Faculty
            Development Programmes. Students of different semesters too participate in
            various events and competitions organized by other academic institutions
            outside the college. Apart from the regular class rooms in the main building
            of the college, the department has a dedicated classroom with a projector in
            the humanities block. The department also maintains a specialised seminar
            library for the students of the Economics (Honours).
            At present this library has 564 books covering more or less all the  papers
            taught at the undergraduate level. In addition to this, students of economics
            (Honours) can also access both the Central Library and the reading room
            library of the college which has 634 and 84 books respectively on the subject.
            New publications are also added to the library at regular intervals so that the
            students can have the knowledge of the latest developments in the subject.
            Students who have graduated from the department in the last academic
            session have displayed a spectacular result with none of them scoring less
            than 60% and the highest being more than 90%. The performance of the
            students of the ongoing semesters in the university examinations is also
            noteworthy.The department also has a glorious past with many notable
            alumni. For instance, Sri Debashis Biswas, Inspector of colleges of the
            University of Calcutta to which this college is affiliated, has graduated from
            this college. In a nutshell, the department provides an encouraging academic
            and intellectual ambience for prospective students.</p>
